# Renewable-and-non-renewable-analysis
I need your help in creating an Energy Dashboard that provides insights into energy consumption, cost efficiency, and emissions. The dashboard should compare renewable and non-renewable energy usage while highlighting key trends over time. Iâ€™d like to see a breakdown of energy consumption across different months and seasons, as well as an analysis of cost differences between energy types.
