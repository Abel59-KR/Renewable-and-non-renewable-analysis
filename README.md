# Renewable-and-non-renewable-analysis
I need your help in creating an Energy Dashboard that provides insights into energy consumption, cost efficiency, and emissions. The dashboard should compare renewable and non-renewable energy usage while highlighting key trends over time. Iâ€™d like to see a breakdown of energy consumption across different months and seasons, as well as an analysis of cost differences between energy types. 
 
The data contained several locations, kindly focus your analysis on locations like: Atlanta, Chicago and New York. 
The visuals should be clear and intuitive, with a modern darkthemed design that effectively highlights key metrics and trends.
